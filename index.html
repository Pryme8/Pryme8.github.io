                     <p>Currently I live in the majestic redwood forests of <strong>Northern California.</strong>  Not much more to say about me other then I am your definition
                         of a nerd.  <strong><i>I love Art, Music, Fun and People...</i></strong> and usually try to find a way to combine as many of those things into my projects as
                     possible.  Self taught and motivated by the thirst of knowledge and ability to better ones self I have gathered an extensive knowledge
                     of design.  Once I reached a level that I could not surpass on my own I went to college for a period and learned as much as I could about
                     the theory of art and its execution along with dynamic website creation.  <strong>Currently I live under the belief that there is nothing in the
                         digital world that is out of my reach.</strong></p>
                     <p>If its client-side Ive done it, if you think its not possible ill figure it out, if you say it cant be done ill do it and show you how.  I love solving problems and have no problem adapting to work-flows and process completely unfamiliar to me.</p>
                     <p>I will be using this site to document my adventure through the internetz and hope that I am able to <i>develop a resource that is helpful
                             in both teaching myself and enlightening others in the pursuit of <strong>absolute design</strong></i>.  If there is anything I have done that you need help
                         with please do not hesitate to contact me, and ask as many questions as you need!  Also if there is anything that you would like to see
                         me take a crack let me know and Ill see what I can do and post a article on the steps and process I took to achieve the goal!
                     </p>

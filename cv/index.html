<h2>Summary</h2>
<div class='content'>Computers have been my life for nearly 20 years, starting when I was 10 with PASCAL; which was used to create my very first full piece of software that was a text based casino game.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although being basic and only having rudimentary text based graphics it featured dice, card games, slot machines, and random events as you traveled around the game.&nbsp;&nbsp;This turned into a full blown passion for learning new systems and languages.&nbsp;&nbsp;I pride myself on the ability to rapidly learn and deploy new systems and become competent as fast as possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;After my freshman year in high school they had ran out of computer classes to challenge me, and tasked me with being the schools server admin as a student.&nbsp;&nbsp;Placing me on a complete independent study program (all programing all day) for all but core classes for the remainder of my time there.&nbsp;&nbsp;My journey through the digital world has been an exciting one with tons of dynamic projects that test and build my abilities as a developer.&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that there is not much that can't be accomplished with enough focus and dedication.&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting to be the lead developer and the &quot;goto&quot; person for quite a few companies has been both challenging and rewarding with most of my past clients still using me as their first solution to digital media problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the time until recently projects have always relied on me as a solo developer even if the scope was well beyond standard expectations for a single programer.&nbsp;&nbsp;If I could have one thing, that would be to surround myself with talented, driven, and intelligent people who all lend their skills to achieving amazing goals while at the same time enjoying what they do. </div>

<h2>Work History</h2>
<div class='content'><h3>Effortless Rental Group</h3>
<div>I created systems for managing multiple high end real estate rentals.&nbsp;&nbsp;This system included an asynchronous iCal parser, that utilized CORS data processing to get around any cross-domain blocks.&nbsp;&nbsp;A employee management system, including a SMS/email notification system for events.&nbsp;&nbsp;A custom UI that presented all the information for all properties/bookings/events in a coherent and easy to use interface.&nbsp;&nbsp;Two and 3-legged oAuth connections to Homeaway, and VRBO API's.&nbsp;&nbsp;A booking system, and a public/private back end with automatic company sub domain websites that featured a employee back end login and other important company management/public front end tools.</div>
</div>

<div class='content'><h3>Propool.com/InsidePool Magazine</h3>
<div>Helped with entire re-branding of the company.&nbsp;&nbsp;Established a Roku TV channel and did 3d commercials and video edits for content, along with promotional offer commercials.&nbsp;&nbsp;Developed a Stat tracking and venue system.&nbsp;&nbsp;A pro-player rating system, and interactive score tracking APP, store front and other services for the company to offer.&nbsp;&nbsp;Reestablished adsense revenue and tailored the established websites to be more SEO compliant.</div>
</div>

<div class='content'><h3>Web Development</h3>
<div>Created and maintained more websites then I care to keep track of, including but not limited to: <a href='http://www.themiraclesalve.com/'>The Miracle Salve</a>, <a href='http://www.parinfinity.net/'>Par-Infinity Disc Golf Club</a>, <a href='http://www.propool.com/'>Pro-Pool</a>, <a href='http://166.62.117.5/~rentalking/eone/'>E-One Platform</a></div>
</div>

<div class='content'><h3>Iverson Dental</h3>
<div>Modernized the office, created web presence, developed and deployed custom cellphone contact APP that relied on QR codes.</div>
</div>

<div  class='content'> <h3>BPO Automation Service</h3>
<div>Worked with real estate client to establish an automated system for Broker Price Opinion, data entry.&nbsp;&nbsp;The system generated human like reports and had a higher accept rate then an actual human propagating the information.&nbsp;&nbsp;BPO's would take an agent anywhere from one to two hours for just the data entry aspect, and this was compounded by having to obtain real photos of the properties and hunt for comparabilities in the MLS system.&nbsp;&nbsp;My software BPObot was able to be given a folder that contained sub-folders with all of the addresses that needed to have their comparable properties pulled and data entered, then would automatically collect the data that was required.&nbsp;&nbsp;The user then confirms the pulled comparables for each property and can manually select others, then the system logs into the appropriate front end website, goes to the correct form for that property and automatically propagates the information into the correct inputs.&nbsp;&nbsp;It then validates the entire form, and generates human like writen comments where requried by drawing from a library of situational statements and variables; then mixes and matches making the written statements to have an organic, human like feel that had a very low chance of ever repeating the same statements in the same order.&nbsp;&nbsp;It would then upload the photos automatically from the sub-folder, generate a report and go on to the next property.&nbsp;&nbsp;We never maxed out the system, but were able to produce 50 BPO reports in a time frame of one hour.&nbsp;&nbsp;The system was so efficient, that we were able to remove the deficit of BPO order needed in the entire Greater Las Vegas Area and had my client put at the top of the list for all BPO orders.&nbsp;&nbsp;This system was extremely successful and was well ahead of the market by years and another similar system did not appear for almost four years after our initial private launch.</div></div>

<div class='content'><h3>Independent Video Game Design</h3>
<div>I have independently developed systems and content for GLSL based games, mainly utilizing webGL.  I have created a gambit of systems and controls for various tasks, a 3d model Serializer, compression and encryption algorithms, procedural content, and physic systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a well known presence in the Babylon.js community and am considered one of the top people for any physic based questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;I also have contributed to the libraries and the public tools, and have demonstrated capabilities of the system other users though were impossible.&nbsp;&nbsp;I just enjoy making stuff, and solve problems all day.</div></div></li>
